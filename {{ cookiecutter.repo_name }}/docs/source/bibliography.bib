	abstract = {Synthesis of pyrolytic carbon as a matrix for carbon fiber reinforced carbon composites by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) is studied experimentally and numerically using the oxygen-containing precursor ethanol. The effects of residence time on microstructure and deposition rate of pyrolytic carbon are investigated. A short residence time is found to favor the formation of high-textured pyrolytic carbon. The evolutions of microstructure and deposition rate of pyrolytic carbon are compared with those of carbon deposited from methane. Compared to methane, ethanol exhibits a much higher deposition rate of pyrolytic carbon with similar microstructures. Pyrolysis of ethanol is modeled using a two-dimensional flow model coupled with a detailed gas-phase reaction mechanism involving 261 species taking part in 1177 reversible reactions. Reaction rate analysis reveals that C3-hydrocarbons are the most important intermediate species contributing to the maturation of gas-phase composition. A comparison of the kinetic predictions with equilibrium calculations demonstrates that the CVD reactor applied is operated far away from equilibrium.},
