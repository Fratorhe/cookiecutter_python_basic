# Scientific Python Cookiecutter for VKI

This repository contains a cookiecutter template for generating a scientific
Python project complete with testing and documentation.

It is a slight modification from the **[cookicutter Scientific Python by NSLS-II](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/)** for the Tools for Scientific Computing course of the Research Master at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics.

```

Separately, beside the cookiecutter template, it contains
[tutorial documentation](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/)
on how to use this template to organize scientific Python code into a package
and use popular tools for testing, documentation, and maintenance.
